# AM6016- Dynamic Machine Learning with Applications
Second assignment from the named course where the libraries tensorflow, keras, numpy and matplotlib were applied.

*the uploaded notebook is with previously ran code for immediate preview on GitHub, whereas the original task requested a Jupyter notebook with cleared output.

It was a two-part task laid out in the following manner:

#### Q1- The CIFAR-10 dataset.

Consider the data in  [`keras.datasets.cifar10`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) and train a network which reliably categorizes the data. 


#### Q2- Deep Learning in Genomics

Consider the following tutorial on using machine learning in genomics:

https://github.com/abidlabs/deep-learning-genomics-primer/blob/master/A_Primer_on_Deep_Learning_in_Genomics_Public.ipynb

a) Thoroughly explain the code in this tutorial by adding markdown cells starting with "# CA"

b) Some code in this tutorial was written for an outdated version of Tensorflow 1.x.  Modify it so that it runs on the current version 2.x without using a compatibility layer. I.e. use `gradient.tape()` to calculate gradients, etc.
